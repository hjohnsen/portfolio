# Portfolio project
The purpose of this project is to replicate, but customize, Udacity's style pdf. This is the first project in [Udacity's Front End Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001), which I am taking thanks to a [Grow with Google scholarship](https://www.udacity.com/grow-with-google)!

## Getting Started
Ensure that the css folder and img folder are in the same directory as index.html. If you open the index.html file in a web browser, it will display.

## Built with
* html
* CSS
* Using Atom

## Requirements
The requirements were to make something that looked similar to their [PDF mockup](https://storage.googleapis.com/supplemental_media/udacityu/2655898586/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf), while customizing it to meet our own needs. Instead of making up random projects, I decided to seed it with data science projects that I have done in the past. The site was also required to be responsive. I mostly did this by adjusting the layout of the individual projects.

## Acknowledgements
Thank you to the Udacity reviewer for their constructive comments.
